In addition, for VS Code users:

1. If you wish to test the `GithubController` routes, you must issue a [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) and create a `.env` file. Use the provided `.env_example` as a template.
2. Install the [Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).
3. Recommended: Install the [VS Intellicode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode) extension for better code suggestions/completion.
4. VSCode tasks are included in this repo as well: press 'F1' or 'Ctrl + Shift + P' and select 'Run Tasks' to access them.
5. You may also run or debug the application using the included debug profile.
